                            It is I, Cuong Pham, and welcome to my humble site.  What is the point of this site you ask?  Well it is an assignment, Week 2 more precisely, and I shall be your guide to the world of Coding Bootcamp with HTML (and CSS) plus BootStrap.  In this assignment, we shall explore the depths of CSS.  Even now you can come to grips with its raw power.  See how the text you are reading wraps around that delicious picture of grilled steak?  That is the power of CSS.  Surely, your mouth must be watering at the sight of such delectable website formatting.  But wait, there's more!  With CSS you can even add the amazing background image of a bunch of cubes!  That is also the power of CSS!  The true power of CSS shall come to life before your very eyes and I shall be your guide.  Come, there is much to see but nothing to do.

                        <p>
                            Here we can see another paragraph.  Interesting, isn't it?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And here is another one!  The power of CSS strikes again!  In its almightly, deity-like might, I have been able to split up this paragraph before your very eyes.  Such formatting would rival the likes of the great Microsoft Word or whatever random text editing software the lowly plebs use. Their power is underwhelming under the all-consuming heel of CSS.  Surely you should be thinking in this moment, how is this magic possible?  What sorcery is this?  Well, allow me to tell you!  But only if you explore the rest of my GitHub repository.
